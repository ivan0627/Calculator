# ðŸ“Œ Interactive Calculator
Hello! This is an application developed with React, an interactive calculator that performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
This is a copy of a project provided by FreeCodeCamp

This application was created by [Estefania Cassingena Navone](https://twitter.com/EstefaniaCassN) for the course [Learn React From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jfk8ic3KVk) published in the freeCodeCamp Spanish YouTube channel. Its initial structure was created with the `npx create-react-app` command.

## Run the Application
To start the application, you need to run the `npm start` command in the terminal. If you work with Visual Studio Code, you can open the terminal with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + Ã±` if your keyboard is in Spanish and with ``ctrl + ` `` if your keyboard is in English.

The app will automatically open in your device's default browser and run on `localhost:3000`.

## Install Modules
To install the necessary modules for the application, you must run the `npm install` command in the terminal.
